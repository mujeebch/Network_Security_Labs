# misc 50

* we are provided with an encryption algorithm, which uses a key of 25 English alphabets
* message is encrytped based on the position of a letter in the key
* we had to implement the decryption which is simply to reverse the encryption logic
* Next a cipher text was provided. We had to use our decryption method but we did not know the key used to encrypt the message.
* we used our decryption method and tried all possible combinations of keys: brute force
* Found the plain text meaningful English sentence and got the flag.
* python files are playfake.py and secrets.py
